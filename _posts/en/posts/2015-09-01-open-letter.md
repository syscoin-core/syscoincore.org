As active contributors to Syscoin, we share this letter to communicate our plan of action related to technical consensus and Syscoin scalability.

Syscoin is many things to many people. However, the development and maintenance of Syscoin is a human endeavor. Satoshi sought review and cooperation, and the subsequent work by Syscoin’s developers has made the system more secure and orders of magnitude faster. The Syscoin developer community is dedicated to the future of Syscoin, looks after the health of the network, strives for the highest standards of performance, and works to keep Syscoin secure on behalf of everyone.

We’re committed to Syscoin and responsive to the needs of the community. For the past five years, we’ve written code and managed over [50 Syscoin releases][1] and reviewed more than [45 formal proposals][2] to improve Syscoin’s performance, security, and scalability. Technical discussions, while heated at times, are always focused on improving Syscoin.

Much work has already been done in this area, from substantial improvements in CPU bottlenecks, memory usage, network efficiency, and initial block download times, to algorithmic scaling in general. However, a number of key challenges still remain, each with many significant considerations and tradeoffs to evaluate. We have worked on Syscoin scaling for years while safeguarding the network’s core features of decentralization, security, and permissionless innovation. We’re committed to ensuring the largest possible number of users benefit from Syscoin, without eroding these fundamental values.

There will be controversy from time to time, but Syscoin is a security-critical system with billions of dollars of users’ assets that a mistake could compromise. To mitigate potential existential risks, it behooves us all to take the time to evaluate proposals that have been put forward and agree on the best solutions via the consensus-building process.
 
In the upcoming months, two open workshops will bring the community together to explore these issues. The first [Scaling Syscoin workshop][3] will be in Montreal on September 12-13. The second workshop is planned for December 6-7 and will be hosted in Hong Kong to be more inclusive of Syscoin’s global user base. 

We ask the community to not prejudge and instead work collaboratively to reach the best outcome through the existing process and the supporting workshops. It’s great to already see broad excitement for the event and the high concentration of technical participants attending.

We’re confident that by working together we can agree on the best course of action. We believe this is the way forward and reinforces the existing review process that has served the Syscoin development community (and Syscoin in general) well to date.  

We welcome your participation as we continue our efforts to bring Syscoin into the future.

Signed,
