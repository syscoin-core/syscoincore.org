4.3.0 Release Notes
======================

Syscoin Core version 4.3.0 is now available from:

  <https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin/releases/tag/v4.3.0>

This release includes new features, various bug fixes and performance
improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:

  <https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin/issues>


Upgrade Instructions: <https://syscoin.readme.io/v4.3.0/docs/syscoin-43-upgrade-guide>
Basic upgrade instructions below:

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Syscoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `syscoind`/`syscoin-qt` (on Linux).

If you are upgrading from a version older than 4.2.0, PLEASE READ: <https://syscoin.readme.io/v4.2.0/docs/syscoin-42-upgrade-guide>

This should reindex your local node and synchronize with the network from genesis.

Compatibility
==============

Syscoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not recommended
to use Syscoin Core on unsupported systems.

A target block height of 1317500 has been set as the upgrade blockheight.
This will happen at approximately December 6th 2021.
A more accurate countdown counter can be found at [syscoin.org](https://www.syscoin.org). 

Nodes not upgraded to Syscoin Core 4.3 will NOT be able to sync up to the network past block 1317500
After the block height, 2 new changes will be activated on the network
1. Syscoin block time will be increased to ~2.5 minutes per block; block reward will be adjusted accordingly
2. Syscoin NEVM will launch

This upgrade brought in upstream changes from Bitcoin from 0.21.1 - 0.22.0 and tracking on the latest commit on master branch.  For changelog brought in from upstream, please see the release notes from Bitcoin Core.
- [0.21.1](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.21.1/)
- [0.22.0](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/22.0/)

Syscoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
as frequently tested on them.

From Syscoin Core 4.1.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no
longer supported. Additionally, Syscoin Core does not yet change appearance
when macOS "dark mode" is activated.

Syscoin Core Changes

### Quorum Type Change
