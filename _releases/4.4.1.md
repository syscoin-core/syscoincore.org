4.4.1 Release Notes
======================

Syscoin Core version 4.4.1 is now available from:

  <https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin/releases/tag/v4.4.1>

This is a hot fix release for users of Syscoin Core on OSX ARM M1/M2 and Windows:

1. Non-supported geth systems like arm OSX M1/M2 should not run geth at all and shouldn't stop at blocks that require NEVM
2. Prune was being enabled on some systems by default which disabled governance which led to coinbase-pays-too-much error which we fixed
3. Windows installer puts binaries in a new location (daemon directory) and we correctly look for sysgeth there on startup
You should just install and run, if you were previous stuck on a block you can reindex to fix.

Note: Masternode operators should upgrade their sentinel to v4.4.0 

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:

  <https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin/issues>


Upgrade Instructions: <https://syscoin.readme.io/v4.4.1/docs/syscoin-441-upgrade-guide>
Basic upgrade instructions below:

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Syscoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `syscoind`/`syscoin-qt` (on Linux).

If you are upgrading from a version older than 4.2.0, PLEASE READ: <https://syscoin.readme.io/v4.2.0/docs/syscoin-42-upgrade-guide>

Compatibility
==============

Syscoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not recommended
to use Syscoin Core on unsupported systems.

A target block height of 1586000 has been set as the upgrade blockheight.
This will happen at approximately March 23rd 2023.

Nodes not upgraded to Syscoin Core 4.4 will NOT be able to sync up to the network past block 1586000
After the block height, 3 new changes will be activated on the network
1. Syscoin PODA will launch which adds logic to consensus code related to keccack based blobs and an NEVM precompile to access it read <https://syscoin.org/news/revealing-the-method-in-the-madness>
2. V19 BLS upgrade to the standard IETF spec <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature/>
3. Specific NEVM upgrades:
  - EIP-3651 warm COINBASE <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3651>
  - EIP-3855 PUSH0 instruction <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855>
  - EIP-3860 Limit and meter initcode <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860>

This upgrade brought in upstream changes from Bitcoin from 22.1 - 24.0.1 and tracking on the latest commit on master branch.  For changelog brought in from upstream, please see the release notes from Bitcoin Core.

longer supported.
