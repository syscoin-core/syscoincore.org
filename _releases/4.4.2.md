4.4.2 Release Notes
======================

Syscoin Core version 4.4.2 is now available from:

  <https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin/releases/tag/v4.4.2>

Hot Fix for the following issues:

- coincontrol issues not selecting the right amounts and crashing if using the "use available balance" button
- presync looping (i think was geth in invalid state, so we just disable geth connection for the sync)
- sendrawtransaction (for sys burn to nevm we skip the max burn check). This should fix pali/blockbook
- gobject_prepare fix which wasn't signing before sending the transaction. Useful for people creating governance proposals
- Large rollback on nevm fix, which causes general issues related to pruning PoDA when transaction is removed from mempool as a "reorg", we shouldn't do this because upon subsequent block validation the block will not validate.

Note: Masternode operators should upgrade their sentinel to v4.4.0 

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:

Upgrade Instructions: <https://syscoin.readme.io/v4.4.2/docs/syscoin-442-upgrade-guide>
Basic upgrade instructions below:

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Syscoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `syscoind`/`syscoin-qt` (on Linux).

If you are upgrading from a version older than 4.2.0, PLEASE READ: <https://syscoin.readme.io/v4.2.0/docs/syscoin-42-upgrade-guide>

Compatibility
==============

Syscoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not recommended
to use Syscoin Core on unsupported systems.

Syscoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
as frequently tested on them.

From Syscoin Core 4.4.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.15 are no
longer supported.
