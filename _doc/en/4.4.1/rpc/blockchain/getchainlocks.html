getchainlocks

Returns information about the active and the most recent chainlocks.
The active chainlock is the one that has enough signatures and the block
it tries to lock is known by our node. The recent chainlock might not have
enough signatures or its block might not be known by our node yet.
Throws an error if there is no known chainlock yet.

Result:
