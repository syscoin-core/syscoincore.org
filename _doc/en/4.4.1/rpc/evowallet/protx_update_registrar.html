protx_update_registrar "proTxHash" "operatorPubKey" "votingAddress" "payoutAddress" ( "feeSourceAddress" legacy )

Creates and sends a ProUpRegTx to the network. This will update the operator key, voting key and payout
address of the masternode specified by "proTxHash".
The owner key of the masternode must be known to your wallet.

Arguments:
1. proTxHash           (string, required) The hash of the initial ProRegTx.
2. operatorPubKey      (string, required) The operator BLS public key. The BLS private key does not have to be known.
                       It has to match the BLS private key which is later used when operating the masternode.
                       If set to an empty string, the currently active operator BLS public key is reused.
3. votingAddress       (string, required) The voting key address. The private key does not have to be known by your wallet.
                       It has to match the private key which is later used when voting on proposals.
                       If set to an empty string, the currently active voting key address is reused.
4. payoutAddress       (string, required) The Syscoin address to use for masternode reward payments.
                       If set to an empty string, the currently active payout address is reused.
5. feeSourceAddress    (string, optional, default="") If specified wallet will only use coins from this address to fund ProTx.
                       If not specified, payoutAddress is the one that is going to be used.
                       The private key belonging to this address must be known in your wallet.
6. legacy              (boolean, optional) Use Legacy BLS scheme (false by default

Result:
"hex"    (string) The transaction hash in hex
