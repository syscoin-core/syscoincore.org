2. address             (string, required) The address to send the asset to (creates an asset allocation).

                       e.g. with 'importpubkey' or 'importmulti' with the 'pubkeys' or 'desc' field.

Result:
{                    (json object)
  "txid" : "hex"     (string) The transaction id
}
