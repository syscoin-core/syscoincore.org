assetallocationsend "asset_guid" "address" amount ( sys_amount replaceable "change_address" include_watching )

Send an asset allocation you own to another address.

Arguments:
1. asset_guid          (string, required) The asset guid
2. address             (string, required) The address to send the allocation to
3. amount              (numeric or string, required) Amount of asset to send
4. sys_amount          (numeric or string) Amount of syscoin to send
5. replaceable         (boolean, optional, default=wallet default) Allow this transaction to be replaced by a transaction with higher fees via BIP 125. ZDAG is only possible if RBF is disabled.
6. change_address      (string) The change address to send to.
7. include_watching    (boolean, optional, default=true for watch-only wallets, otherwise false) Also select inputs which are watch only.
                       Only solvable inputs can be used. Watch-only destinations are solvable if the public key and/or output script was imported,
                       e.g. with 'importpubkey' or 'importmulti' with the 'pubkeys' or 'desc' field.

Result:
{                    (json object)
  "txid" : "hex"     (string) The transaction id
}
