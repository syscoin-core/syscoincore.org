assetallocationverifyzdag "txid"

Show status as it pertains to any current Z-DAG conflicts or warnings related to a ZDAG transaction.
Return value is in the status field and can represent 3 levels(0, 1 or 2)
Level -1 means not found, not a ZDAG transaction, perhaps it is already confirmed.
Level 0 means OK.
Level 1 means warning (checked that in the mempool there are more spending balances than current POW sender balance). An active stance should be taken and perhaps a deeper analysis as to potential conflicts related to the sender.
Level 2 means an active double spend was found and any depending asset allocation sends are also flagged as dangerous and should wait for POW confirmation before proceeding.

Arguments:
1. txid    (string, required) The transaction id of the ZDAG transaction.

Result:
{                  (json object)
  "status" : n     (numeric) The status level of the transaction
}
