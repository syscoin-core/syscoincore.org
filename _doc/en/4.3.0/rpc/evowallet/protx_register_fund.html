protx_register_fund "collateralAddress" "ipAndPort" "ownerAddress" "operatorPubKey" "votingAddress" operatorReward "payoutAddress" ( "fundAddress" submit )

Creates, funds and sends a ProTx to the network. The resulting transaction will move 100000 Syscoin
to the address specified by collateralAddress and will then function as the collateral of your
masternode.

2. ipAndPort            (string, required) IP and port in the form "IP:PORT".
                        Must be unique on the network. Can be set to 0, which will require a ProUpServTx afterwards.
3. ownerAddress         (string, required) The Syscoin address to use for payee updates and proposal voting.
                        The corresponding private key does not have to be known by your wallet.
                        The address must be unused and must differ from the collateralAddress.
4. operatorPubKey       (string, required) The operator BLS public key. The BLS private key does not have to be known.
                        It has to match the BLS private key which is later used when operating the masternode.
5. votingAddress        (string, required) The voting key address. The private key does not have to be known by your wallet.
                        It has to match the private key which is later used when voting on proposals.
                        If set to an empty string, ownerAddress will be used.
                        
6. operatorReward       (numeric, required) The fraction in %% to share with the operator. The value must be
                        between 0.00 and 100.00.
7. payoutAddress        (string, required) The Syscoin address to use for masternode reward payments.
8. fundAddress          (string, optional, default="") If specified wallet will only use coins from this address to fund ProTx.
                        If not specified, payoutAddress is the one that is going to be used.
                        The private key belonging to this address must be known in your wallet.
9. submit               (boolean) If true, the resulting transaction is sent to the network.
