protx_update_service "proTxHash" "ipAndPort" "operatorKey" ( "operatorPayoutAddress" "feeSourceAddress" )

Creates and sends a ProUpServTx to the network. This will update the IP address
of a masternode.
If this is done for a masternode that got PoSe-banned, the ProUpServTx will also revive this masternode.

Arguments:
1. proTxHash                (string, required) The hash of the initial ProRegTx.
2. ipAndPort                (string, required) IP and port in the form "IP:PORT".
                            Must be unique on the network. Can be set to 0, which will require a ProUpServTx afterwards.
3. operatorKey              (string, required) The operator BLS private key associated with the
                            registered operator public key.
4. operatorPayoutAddress    (string, optional, default="") The address used for operator reward payments.
                            Only allowed when the ProRegTx had a non-zero operatorReward value.
                            If set to an empty string, the currently active payout address is reused.
5. feeSourceAddress         (string, optional, default="") If specified wallet will only use coins from this address to fund ProTx.
                            If not specified, payoutAddress is the one that is going to be used.
                            The private key belonging to this address must be known in your wallet.

Result:
"hex"    (string) The transaction hash in hex
