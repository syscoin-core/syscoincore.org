getblock "blockhash" ( verbosity )

If verbosity is 0, returns a string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for block 'hash'.
If verbosity is 1, returns an Object with information about block <hash>.
If verbosity is 2, returns an Object with information about block <hash> and information about each transaction.
If verbosity is 3, returns an Object with information about block <hash> and information about each transaction, including prevout information for inputs (only for unpruned blocks in the current best chain).

Arguments:
1. blockhash    (string, required) The block hash
2. verbosity    (numeric, optional, default=1) 0 for hex-encoded data, 1 for a json object, and 2 for json object with transaction data

Result (for verbosity = 0):
"hex"    (string) A string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for block 'hash'

Result (for verbosity = 1):
{                                 (json object)
  "hash" : "hex",                 (string) the block hash (same as provided)
  "confirmations" : n,            (numeric) The number of confirmations, or -1 if the block is not on the main chain

    ...
  ],
  "time" : xxx,                   (numeric) The block time expressed in UNIX epoch time
  "mediantime" : xxx,             (numeric) The median block time expressed in UNIX epoch time
  "nonce" : n,                    (numeric) The nonce
  "bits" : "hex",                 (string) The bits
  "difficulty" : n,               (numeric) The difficulty
  "chainwork" : "hex",            (string) Expected number of hashes required to produce the chain up to this block (in hex)
  "nTx" : n,                      (numeric) The number of transactions in the block

  "nextblockhash" : "hex",        (string, optional) The hash of the next block (if available)
  "auxpow" : {                    (json object) The auxpow object attached to this block
    "tx" : {                      (json object) The parent chain coinbase tx of this auxpow
      ...
    },
    "index" : n,                  (numeric) Merkle index of the parent coinbase
    "merklebranch" : [            (json array) Merkle branch's of the parent coinbase
      "hex",                      (string) Merkle branch
      ...
    ],
    "chainindex" : n,             (numeric) Index in the auxpow Merkle tree

    {               (json object)
      ...,          The transactions in the format of the getrawtransaction RPC. Different from verbosity = 1 "tx" result
      "fee" : n     (numeric) The transaction fee in SYS, omitted if block undo data is not available
    },
    ...
