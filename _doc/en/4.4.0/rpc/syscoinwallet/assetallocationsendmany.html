Send an asset allocation you own to another address. Maximum recipients is 250.

Arguments:
1. amounts                        (json array, required) Array of assetallocationsend objects
     [
       {                          (json object) The assetallocationsend object
         "asset_guid": "str",     (string, required) Asset guid
         "address": "str",        (string, required) Address to transfer to
         "amount": amount,        (numeric or string, required) Amount of asset to send
         "sys_amount": amount,    (numeric or string) Amount of Syscoin to send
       },
       ...
     ]
2. replaceable                    (boolean, optional, default=wallet default) Allow this transaction to be replaced by a transaction with higher fees via BIP 125. ZDAG is only possible if RBF is disabled.

4. conf_target                    (numeric, optional, default=wallet default) Confirmation target (in blocks)
5. estimate_mode                  (string, optional, default="unset") The fee estimate mode, must be one of (case insensitive):
                                  "unset"
                                  "economical"

6. change_address                 (string) The change address to send to.
7. include_watching               (boolean, optional, default=true for watch-only wallets, otherwise false) Also select inputs which are watch only.
                                  Only solvable inputs can be used. Watch-only destinations are solvable if the public key and/or output script was imported,
                                  e.g. with 'importpubkey' or 'importmulti' with the 'pubkeys' or 'desc' field.
