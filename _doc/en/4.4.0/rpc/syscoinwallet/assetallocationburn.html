assetallocationburn "asset_guid" amount ( "nevm_destination_address" "change_address" include_watching )

Burn an asset allocation in order to use the bridge or move back to Syscoin

Arguments:
1. asset_guid                  (string, required) Asset guid
2. amount                      (numeric or string, required) Amount of asset to burn to SYSX
3. nevm_destination_address    (string) The 20 byte (40 character) hex string of the nevm destination address. Omit or leave empty to burn to Syscoin.
4. change_address              (string) The change address to send to.
5. include_watching            (boolean, optional, default=true for watch-only wallets, otherwise false) Also select inputs which are watch only.
                               Only solvable inputs can be used. Watch-only destinations are solvable if the public key and/or output script was imported,
                               e.g. with 'importpubkey' or 'importmulti' with the 'pubkeys' or 'desc' field.
