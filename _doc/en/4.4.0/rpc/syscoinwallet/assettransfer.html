assettransfer "asset_guid" "address" ( "change_address" include_watching )

Perform a transfer of ownership on an asset you control.

Arguments:
1. asset_guid          (string, required) Asset guid
2. address             (string, required) New owner of asset.
3. change_address      (string) The change address to send to.
4. include_watching    (boolean, optional, default=true for watch-only wallets, otherwise false) Also select inputs which are watch only.
                       Only solvable inputs can be used. Watch-only destinations are solvable if the public key and/or output script was imported,
                       e.g. with 'importpubkey' or 'importmulti' with the 'pubkeys' or 'desc' field.

Result:
{                    (json object)
  "txid" : "hex"     (string) The transaction id
}

> syscoin-cli assettransfer "asset_guid" "address"
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id": "curltest", "method": "assettransfer", "params": ["asset_guid", "address"]}' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8370/
