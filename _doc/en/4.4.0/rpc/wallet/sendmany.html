                             Those recipients will receive less syscoins than you enter in their corresponding amount field.
                             If no addresses are specified here, the sender pays the fee.
     [
       "address",            (string) Subtract fee from this address

Examples:

Send two amounts to two different addresses:
> syscoin-cli sendmany "" "{\"sys1q09vm5lfy0j5reeulh4x5752q25uqqvz34hufdl\":0.01,\"sys1qtyf33aa2tl62xhrzhralpytka0krxvt0a4e8ee\":0.02}"

Send two amounts to two different addresses setting the confirmation and comment:
> syscoin-cli sendmany "" "{\"sys1q09vm5lfy0j5reeulh4x5752q25uqqvz34hufdl\":0.01,\"sys1qtyf33aa2tl62xhrzhralpytka0krxvt0a4e8ee\":0.02}" 6 "testing"

Send two amounts to two different addresses, subtract fee from amount:
> syscoin-cli sendmany "" "{\"sys1q09vm5lfy0j5reeulh4x5752q25uqqvz34hufdl\":0.01,\"sys1qtyf33aa2tl62xhrzhralpytka0krxvt0a4e8ee\":0.02}" 1 "" "[\"sys1q09vm5lfy0j5reeulh4x5752q25uqqvz34hufdl\",\"sys1qtyf33aa2tl62xhrzhralpytka0krxvt0a4e8ee\"]"
